SatCom.groundStation.packetGenerator[*].rng-0 = 2 * ancestorIndex(0)
SatCom.terminal[*].rng-0 = 2 * ancestorIndex(0) + 1
# i.e.
# *.groundStation.packetGenerator[0].rng-0 = 0
# *.terminal[0].rng-0 = 1
# *.groundStation.packetGenerator[1].rng-0 = 2
# *.terminal[1].rng-0 = 3

# *.groundStation.packetGenerator[terminalCount - 1].rng-0 = 2N - 2
# *.terminal[terminalCount - 1].rng-0 = 2 * terminalCount - 1
#
# We need 2 * terminalCount independent strem of random numbers because:
#  1. Each terminal must have its strem of coding rates, independent from the other terminals
#  2. Each terminal must have its stream of packet arrival times and packet sizes
# 	Note that the last two factors are independent "by design", hence 
# 	 we only need another terminalCount independent streams (and not 2 * terminalCount)	
# 	This is because, whatever the distributions, a packetGenerator always extracts:
#	 one size, one arrival time, one size, one arrival time, ...
